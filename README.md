## Component Lifecycle Methods

Each component that you write has multiple 'lifecycle methods'. These methods are methods that ywe can override to run code at certain times in our components lifecycle. [Here is the react documentation on lifecycle methods.](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) There are multiple stages of a components lifecycle.

### Common Lifecycles

- Mounting
  - constructor()
  - render()
  - componentDidMount()
- Updating
  - render()
  - componentDidUpdate()
- Unmounting
  - componentWillUnmount()

### Components We will use

  - ???
- `Toggle between all pokemons and our team`
- `Set An interval to show time application is up and clear it when necessary?`
